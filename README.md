This application is a rails front end portion of the Go Team Final Project @ DBC

# Concept & Introduction

It is generally difficult to find casual pick-up games across most recreational activities, and more often than not, the skill variance amongst atheletes greatly reduce the overall quality of such games.

This application is meant to provide matchmaking service and automation for casual athletes across all popular sports with an exciting and easy to use interface.
